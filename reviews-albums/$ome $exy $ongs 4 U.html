              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p style="color: var(--text-color); text-indent: 15px;">
                This Valentine’s Day, we have been met with a highly anticipated collab project from two of Canada’s finest. Rumors of a PND x Drake album have been floating around for a while now but officially got a release date and name on February 3rd, 2025, with quite a bit of hype being garnered from their respective fanbases. These two are no strangers to collaborating with one another having had amazing musical chemistry on tracks in the past such as “Recognize”, “Come and See Me”, and “Since Way Back” which were all very positively received overall. With this latest edition of their joint efforts, we get a full length twenty one track project blending styles of both R&B and Hip-hop.

              <h3>Production & Sound</h3>
              <p style="color: var(--text-color); text-indent: 15px;">
                This album definitely has its fair share of producers with a lot of the beats coming from producers Kid Masterpiece, DJ Lewis, O Lil Angel, Noel Cadastre, and even PARTYNEXTDOOR himself in some cases. Off rip, we are met with a silky smooth instrumental on “CN TOWER” which lays the foundation of the sounds coming up. In its entirety, the production on this album was fairly well versed with incorporations of both mellow and upbeat tracks as seen with the contrast between “SMALL TOWN FAME” and “GIMME A HUG” for example.
                The instrumentals on this work are solid. The beats don’t expand across too much of the horizon nor do they try to mesh into something that doesn’t work for either artist. Nothing too out of the ordinary but it is well received for a collaboration between the two. There are moments in the beat selection that dull down the playthrough especially during a complete start to end listening experience but they tend to work well in a sense of individuality.
                In terms of atmosphere, the tracks jump around between slow and fast paced while keeping a loose theme of sensual nature.

              <h3>Lyrical Content</h3>
              <p style="color: var(--text-color); text-indent: 15px;">
                In terms of lyrical content, we as listeners are met with a majority of sensual melodic serenades and harmonies from both Drake and PND respectively. Seeing that this was planned for a Valentine’s Day release, it makes sense that the lyrics come off as more love exclusive than toxic, which we know both artists are VERY capable of being. 
              </p>
              
              <br><hr><br>

              <h3>Flow & Cohesion</h3>
              <p style="color: var(--text-color); text-indent: 15px;">
                I must say, for a collaborative project, these two feel very distant from one another to the point where it’s almost kind of like two solo projects being combined into one. There are instances on this tape, like “GIMME A HUG”, where PND completely takes the bench and Drake takes the entire track for himself and vice versa. Granted, in this specific example, the record could potentially be seen as a diss so it would make sense for PND to stay off the track but at the same time it begs the question of why even include it into the project in the first place? This feels similar to that of Drake’s previous collab album, “Her Loss”, where 21 Savage felt like more of a backup performer than the second half to the collab.
                Speaking of PARTYNEXTDOOR… where was he during the majority of this album? PND’s presence comes off as very minimal throughout the album. As I mentioned previously, Drake took the majority of the shine on this collaboration but it also feels like PND provided barely anything memorable to this collection whatsoever. While I did enjoy his additions to the tape with his sonically pleasing performance on “DEEPER”, I feel like he didn’t do anything that hasn’t been heard before.  
                On top of the rather lackluster cohesion from both artists, this album feels pretty bloated and, in my opinion, goes on for a bit too long with very little reward in the end. I’m not always one to say that a project is too long but over an hour of these two going on about romantic topics can get a bit draining on the ears. I noticed this especially around the halfway mark of my third listen. I feel that a reduction of tracks would have definitely helped smooth out the bumpier areas of this project and made for a more comfortable sit through.
                While these two shine in their respective zones, it would’ve been nice to see them really put their melodic sounds together in a more… collaborative way rather than going the tag team route for the majority of the album. With Drake’s iconic voice and lyrical nature and PND euphoric style and flow, there definitely could’ve been other areas to touch on and create something more refreshing even if it did come off as a little experimental. While this does come off as more of a “fun Drake album” as many have begun to call it, a crucial detail to this project is that it is NOT a solo Drake album, it’s a collaborative work with pretty miniscule collaboration at that. In terms of overall cohesion, I would say that the mark was greatly missed on this work.                           
              </p>

              <h3>Standout Tracks</h3>
              <p style="color: var(--text-color); text-indent: 15px;">
                <h3>DIE TRYING</h3>
                The upbeat summer-like instrumental meshes well with what is quite possibly the best iteration of Drake and PND merging their distinct sounds into one that we’ve seen on this project thus far. The Yebba feature is also a very nice touch. It adds a secondary sense of character and emphasizes that joyous feeling that resonates from this song. This is the chemistry that would’ve been rather nice to see followed throughout the entire project and really brings a refreshing take on the style brought from PND and Drake in terms of their unison.<br><br>
                
                <h3>GIMME A HUG</h3>
                  I can’t not talk about this track considering that Drake seemingly spoke on the beef between him and Kendrick Lamar. Now, is this a diss track? No. Not at all. In actuality, this is pretty on brand for traditional Drake fashion where instead of devoting an entire song to dissing another artist, he simply throws subtle jabs towards them without blatantly stating names. The main bar that could be seen as a “sneak diss” would be,<br><br>
                
                <p style="color: #036f03; text-align: center;">“Funny how it’s only b*tch n*ggs that are waiting on the boy’s obituary
                ‘Cause if I die, it’s these n*ggas that become the sole beneficiary
                And what the f*ck are they gon’ do with it?
                Head of girls up at 29, on stage twerkin' with a dictionary”</p><br>
                
                This is pretty clearly a shot towards Kendrick who is known for using complex wording and double entendres in his songs.
                I’ll say this to those seeing this as a reignition. Don’t count on it. I don’t think Drake is calling Kendrick out again or at least not so early. This is just Drake doing what he used to do all the time in the past on tracks like, “Charged Up” and “6PM In New York”. 
                Among other topics regarding the beef, he speaks of his gratitude towards 21 Savage for sticking with him and relinquishes the beef altogether stating that he was placed on the planet to show women a great time.<br><br>

                  <p style="color: #036f03; text-align: center">”Fuck a rap beef, I’m tryna get the party lit
                       Tryna get the party lit for the bitches”</p><br>
                
                It’s an okay track I’d say. Doesn’t really feel like it belongs on this particular project given the very loose but still very much present theme of romance but to each his own.<br><br>
                
                
                <h3>MEET YOUR PADRE</h3>
                  Okay so… this track is actually egregious. I just gotta know the thought process behind the creation of this one. About 70% of this gruesome four minute song is sung in a very awkward style of Spanish. Drake is no stranger when it comes to incorporating foreign dialects into his music however, this isn’t an example of one of his borderline decent executions. PARTYNEXTDOOR also pitched into singing in the same language and does a better job than his co-artist but as seen on other tracks, his placement just feels separate from the rest of the song.<br><br>
                
                <h3>GLORIOUS</h3>
                  I listened to this track three times through my analysis and I can honestly say that it got worse each time. The Ice Spice/Central Cee inspired flow from Drake was far less than pleasing on the ears and PARTYNEXTDOOR’s inclusion, while somewhat catchy, felt out of place and random. To follow up with the random nature of inclusion, even this song’s placement on the tracklist felt like a last minute throw-in, adding nothing to the rhythm of the project. To me, the track just felt highly unnecessary and was quite honestly just a bad listen in its entirety. It holds about the same weight as “MEET YOUR PADRE” but the two are almost equally bad.<br>

              <h3>Cover Art</h3>
              <p style="color: var(--text-color)">
                This cover is... interesting I guess you could say. Neither Drake nor PARTYNEXTDOOR are really notorious for having amazing cover art. This is just another addition to the list of covers that are generally seen as, "okay, but would work better for a single."<br>
                I will say it is one of the better ones based on the colors and simple styling but it generally just feels like an IG post rather than something I could see holding a vinyl record or CD.
              </p>

              <br><hr><br>

              <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
              <p style="color: var(--text-color); text-indent: 15px;">
                In all honesty, this project is not for me. While it does have some relatively memorable highs, there are too many lows for me to actually consider this a solid album. The entire thing just feels a bit dated and forced rather than a true staple piece for either of the two's discographies. PARTYNEXTDOOR felt like more of a feature or cameo rather than someone pulling weight and Drake utilized his typical flow and cadence which, while iconic, can get pretty bland on a TWENTY-ONE track album. I feel like there was a lot of potential with this idea but the execution was not that great.<br>
                A lot of my disappointment really falls from the fact that they barely even tried to blend their styles together and instead prioritized working on their own pieces in a separate manner. The whole, back and forth style may work well with previous collaborations like Future and 21 Savage but for Drake and PARTYNEXTDOOR? This could’ve really been something euphoric and sensually ethereal but instead it turned into more of a dragging lot of thrown together tracks that ultimately made a very small impact in terms of musical depth.<br>
                While this isn’t anywhere close to a completely bad project, it definitely falls into the category of one of the more forgettable releases this year thus far. Yes, it has good moments and some quality tracks but in terms of a good collaboration, it is far from that standard. It's safe to say that these $exy $ongs were in fact, not 4 me.
