              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p style="color: var(--text-color)">
                After a streak of quality releases from Mac Miller’s estate, we have been given yet another posthumous release in the form of the long sidelined project, “Balloonerism”. This album was originally created back in 2014 but was set aside for the release of Mac’s eleventh mixtape “Faces”. When asked why, he would state that the project was simply too experimental at the time compared to the more defined tones of his mixtape. Even though the album went unfinalized, fans would still find tracks from the project, listen to them in their raw forms, and find it to be quite enjoyable. Knowing this, Mac’s estate decided to go forward with this release to provide for the fans and honor the artist's legacy by sharing a project that was very important to him. After 11 years, does this project, in its final rendition, hold strong amongst Mac Miller’s discography?

              <h3>Production & Sound</h3>
              <p style="color: var(--text-color)">
                The general sound of this project is complimented by an ethereal vibe which adds to the melancholic tone and further pushes the theme of death and ascension. The opening track, “Tambourine Dream”, is a short clip of a tambourine that works as a means of transition towards the mellow style that the further tracks provide. Each instrumental keeps the general theme of the airy soundscape but each does so in their own special way. None of the beats sound like anything that has already been heard yet they still manage to fit cohesively into this lugubrious style. 
                What makes this form even more fitting is the fact that it has slight variations to the emotion that it resonates. Mac Miller’s sound originated from the jazz-rap subgenre and he made sure to incorporate the custom into his works all the way until his passing. This technique is still implemented in this project and creates a means to be able to efficiently swap between mellow and upbeat tones with the best example of that being heard on the song, 
              “5 Dollar Pony Rides”, where both tones exist on this single track. I love the incorporation of this element because it allows for Mac to experiment while not breaching the flair of the project. This is why such a transition between “Excelsior”, which has a more smooth and cohesive jazz-centered rhythm, and “Transformations” which holds a similar rhythm but in a more chaotic fashion can exist and not disrupt the flow of the experience. The incorporation of jazz structures is simply flawless throughout this album as it really glues things together while staying true to the experimentation being undergone.
                One song that really caught my ear in terms of production was easily the closing track, “Tomorrow Will Never Know”, produced by Mac Miller under the alias of Larry Fisherman. Being paired with lyrics of life and death (which I’ll touch on later) the instrumental feels like the perfect choice as it blends deep atmospheric sounds and noises to create what feels like an ascension. Seeing the connections made between drug use and sound that Balloonerism has made, it adds depth to the complexity of this track as the beat could be interpreted as a metaphor for a drug trip being compared to that of moving onto the afterlife.
                All in all, the sound design and choices made during the creation of these tracks truly compliment the theme of the album. The instrumentals go hand in hand with Mac’s somber lyrics and mellow style of rapping and singing giving us the iconic feel that we’ve come to know and love him for while simultaneously generating a fresher addition to his catalog.
              
              It reminds me a lot of a similar technique used in Ethel Cain’s song “Televangelism” where Ethel (who produced the song) made sure to incorporate airy vibrations and tones to better convey the feeling.

              <h3>Lyrical Content</h3>
              <p style="color: var(--text-color)">
                The lyrics on this album can jump around from genuine happiness to reflective sadness and even that of a more haunting nature with many of these lyrics being a reference to the late musician’s untimely demise. It is almost spine chilling hearing Mac make so many references to his own death in a somewhat specific fashion. There are some that are complete coincidences such as this line on “Funny Papers”,

                <br><br>
                <p style="color: #036f03; text-align: center;">“Saw his pictures in the funny papers
                <br>Didn’t think anybody died on a Friday”</p><br>
                
                Which correlates to the artist passing on Friday, September 18th, 2018.
                Then there are other lines that are up for interpretation such as,
                
                <br><br>
                <p style="color: #036f03; text-align: center;">“Okay, I went to sleep faded, then I woke up invisible”</p><br>

                This line of course could allude to death or the idea of dying in a sense or the a more poetic way of describing the feeling of waking up post intoxication.<br><br>
                
                I’m not one to make theories on matters like this as I find them to be rather distasteful. I bring these lines up for the sole reason of pointing out how the event of Mac Miller’s passing gives these lyrics and this entire project a whole new weight. It is also why I am grateful for his estate continuing to release his art in a tasteful manner.
                
                <br>Apart from the evocative lyrics, we are also met with genuine substance and great storytelling from Mac on this album. In the song, “Stoned”, we follow Mac’s experience as he venture’s through the mind of a girl who has had a tough life with issues at home and relationships. As the song progresses Mac explains how he gets stoned to “reach Heaven” and relax, leaving the world behind through drugs for peace.
                
                The idea of using drugs as a means of finding peace is not new in Mac’s discography by any means but the way it is presented on this project through his more poetic lyricism makes it feel new.
